**Core Mobile Enhancements:**

- Offline-first PWA: Cache posts, sync when online
- Native camera integration: Direct photo posting
 import image from camers, max:2mb
- Push notifications: Daily post reminders
- Touch-optimized trading: Swipe to buy/sell NFTs
Mobile wallet integration: Seamless Starknet wallet connect


**Mobile-Specific Innovation:**

- Location-based posts: Geo-tagged daily content
- AR filters: Custom filters for daily photos
- Voice notes: Audio posts as NFTs
- Quick share: Mobile-native social sharing


Check If your current smart contract already:

✅ Mints NFTs for daily posts
✅ Handles NFT transfers/swaps
✅ Works reliably


Why No Contract Changes Needed if above is correct:
Mobile track judges care about:

How smooth the app feels on phones
UI/UX quality
Performance and responsiveness
Native mobile features

They don't care about:

Smart contract architecture
Gas optimizations (unless it breaks UX)
Advanced Cairo patterns

Your Winning Strategy:
100% effort on:

PWA implementation
Mobile-first UI redesign
Camera integration
Offline functionality
Push notifications
Touch gestures for NFT trading
Fast wallet connection

0% effort on:

Rewriting contracts
Adding DeFi features
Complex tokenomics
Account abstraction (nice-to-have, not required)

Exception:
Only touch the contract if:

Current UX has friction (too many transactions, high gas)
Something is broken
You need a specific mobile feature that requires contract changes

Bottom line: Your smart contract is infrastructure. Mobile track is won with frontend excellence. Ship a beautiful, fast mobile experience and let your existing contracts do their job.

High Priority (Security/Functionality):

Fix interface inconsistency (content_hash type mismatch)
Correct swappable logic (posts should only be swappable after next day's post)
Add emergency pause mechanism
Optimize inefficient loops (get_swap_proposals is O(n))

Medium Priority (Features):
5. Add creator royalties on NFT swaps/transfers
6. Add post metadata (title, description) storage
7. Implement proper pagination for large datasets
8. Add batch operations for multiple actions

Low Priority (UX/Optimization):
9. Gas optimizations in storage and loops
10. Better error messages and validation
11. Additional events for better indexing
12. Fix token_uri IPFS CID reconstruction

# New improvement

the contract yourcontractbytearray.cairo is the main contract, effect all changes done to the yourcontractbytearray.cairo but user be able to sell their post anytime they like, let post be sellable by adding an amount, post should be sell from creator to buyer which becomes the owner and from the owner to another buyer(secondary sell). remove everything concerning swap including functions, let it functions be sell for easy understanding, focusing on selling nfts.

2: edit functions create_daily_post to create_post and should be sellable not swap, function propose_swap to propose_sell, function accept_swap to accept_sell. let the contract be focus strictly on sell.


Problems Identified
1. SoldNFTsModal Not Showing Sold NFTs
The modal calls getSoldNFTs() from packages/frontend/src/services/contract.ts
This function only retrieves sold NFTs from localStorage ('soldNFTs' key)
localStorage is only populated when the current user successfully buys an NFT (in the buyPost function)
Result: The modal only shows NFTs that the current user has personally purchased, not all sold NFTs globally

Solutions
For SoldNFTsModal:
Short-term fix: Change the modal to use getAllSoldNFTs() instead of getSoldNFTs() to show global sold history
Long-term fix: Implement proper event querying from the Starknet contract to get accurate sold NFT data with real transaction details

Additional Issues Found:
getAllSoldNFTs() uses a hack: it assumes any post where author !== currentOwner is sold, which may not be accurate
It generates mock transaction hashes instead of real ones
No real sale timestamps or prices are tracked
Recommended Implementation:
The proper solution would be to:

Add event emission in the smart contract for NFT sales
Query past events from the blockchain to get accurate sold NFT history
Store this data properly instead of relying on localStorage or ownership assumptions
This would require smart contract changes and event indexing implementation.







New improvements

Contract update
- no need for accepting and rejecting sell
- add transfer of strk for buying of posts, and setting proposal price to be in strk

for sold nfts, solution one is
Add event emission in the smart contract for NFT sales
Query past events from the blockchain to get accurate sold NFT history

solution two is to have a mapping of a user to their sold nfts
