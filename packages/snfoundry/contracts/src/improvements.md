Check If your current smart contract already:

✅ Handles NFT transfers/swaps
✅ Works reliably


Why No Contract Changes Needed if above is correct:
Mobile track judges care about:

How smooth the app feels on phones
UI/UX quality
Performance and responsiveness
Native mobile features

They don't care about:

Smart contract architecture
Gas optimizations (unless it breaks UX)
Advanced Cairo patterns

Your Winning Strategy:
100% effort on:

PWA implementation
Mobile-first UI redesign
Camera integration
Offline functionality
Push notifications
Touch gestures for NFT trading
Fast wallet connection

0% effort on:

Rewriting contracts
Adding DeFi features
Complex tokenomics
Account abstraction (nice-to-have, not required)

Exception:
Only touch the contract if:

Current UX has friction (too many transactions, high gas)
Something is broken
You need a specific mobile feature that requires contract changes

Bottom line: Your smart contract is infrastructure. Mobile track is won with frontend excellence. Ship a beautiful, fast mobile experience and let your existing contracts do their job.
