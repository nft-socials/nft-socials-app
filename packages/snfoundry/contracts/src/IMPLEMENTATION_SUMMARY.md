# Contract Improvements Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the contract improvements as requested in `improvements.md`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Smart Contract Updates (`YourContractByteArray.cairo`)

#### Removed Functions
- `accept_sell()` - No longer needed for direct buying
- `reject_sell()` - No longer needed for direct buying
- Corresponding event structs: `SellAccepted`, `SellRejected`

#### Added STRK Token Integration
- Added `IERC20` interface for STRK token interactions
- Added `strk_token_address` storage variable
- Updated constructor to accept STRK token address parameter
- Modified `buy_post()` function to handle STRK token transfers:
  - Transfers STRK from buyer to seller
  - Handles royalty payments (5% to original author)
  - Uses `IERC20Dispatcher` for token transfers

#### Added Sold NFTs Tracking (Solution 2)
- Added `user_sold_nfts` mapping: `Map<(ContractAddress, u32), u256>`
- Added `user_sold_nft_count` mapping: `Map<ContractAddress, u32>`
- Added `get_user_sold_nfts()` function to retrieve user's sold NFTs
- Updates sold NFTs mapping when NFTs are sold in `buy_post()`

#### Updated Interface (`IonePostDaily.cairo`)
- Removed `accept_sell` and `reject_sell` from interface
- Added `get_user_sold_nfts` function to interface

### 2. Frontend Updates

#### Contract Service (`services/contract.ts`)
- Removed `acceptSell()` and `rejectSell()` functions
- Updated `buyPost()` function to handle STRK token approvals:
  - Gets post price before purchase
  - Creates STRK token contract instance
  - Approves STRK tokens for NFT contract
  - Executes purchase transaction
- Added `getUserSoldNFTs()` function to query contract mapping
- Updated imports to include STRK token ABI and address

#### Hooks (`hooks/usePostNFT.ts`)
- Removed `acceptSellProposal` and `rejectSellProposal` functions
- Updated imports to remove accept/reject sell functions
- Updated return object to exclude removed functions

#### UI Components
- **SellModal**: Updated to show STRK prices instead of ETH
  - Changed labels from "ETH" to "STRK"
  - Updated placeholder and minimum values
  - Updated price conversion logic
- **MarketplaceGrid**: Updated error messages and success toasts to reference STRK
- **SoldNFTsModal**: Updated all price displays to show STRK instead of ETH
- **BrowseSwaps**: Updated success messages to reference STRK

#### Context (`context/AppContext.tsx`)
- Removed swap-related functions from `AppContextType` interface
- Fixed import naming conflicts
- Updated to use simplified selling model

### 3. Key Benefits of Implementation

#### Simplified User Experience
- Direct buying without proposal acceptance/rejection
- Streamlined transaction flow
- Reduced gas costs (fewer transactions)

#### STRK Token Integration
- Native STRK token payments
- Automatic royalty distribution
- Proper token approval handling

#### Better Sold NFTs Tracking
- Contract-level mapping for reliable data
- Event emission for audit trail (Solution 1 already existed)
- Dual approach provides flexibility

## Deployment Requirements

### Contract Deployment
The updated contract requires redeployment with:
```cairo
constructor(strk_token_address: ContractAddress)
```

STRK token address for Sepolia: `0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d`

### Frontend Configuration
Update `deployedContracts.ts` with new contract address after deployment.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **STRK Token Approval Flow**
   - Test insufficient allowance scenarios
   - Test insufficient balance scenarios
   - Verify proper approval amounts

2. **Direct Buying Flow**
   - Test successful purchases
   - Test royalty calculations and transfers
   - Verify sold NFTs mapping updates

3. **Price Display**
   - Verify all UI components show STRK instead of ETH
   - Test price formatting and conversions

4. **Sold NFTs Tracking**
   - Test `getUserSoldNFTs()` function
   - Verify mapping updates correctly
   - Test with multiple sales per user

## Migration Notes

- Users will need to approve STRK tokens before purchasing
- Existing sell proposals will still work with direct buying
- No data migration needed for existing posts
- Sold NFTs tracking starts fresh with new contract
